# easy_tensorflow_fcn
fcn realization by tensorflow and python3 This project is a reconstruction version of the kittiseg which is maintained by the MarvinTeichmann.https://github.com/MarvinTeichmann/KittiSeg#kittiseg He used python2.7 and tensorflow 1.0 to realize it, and I think maybe I can implement it in python3 and adjust some file to make the code be more readable. Have fun.
